# Fashion Store — Demo static site

This is a simple static e-commerce demo called **Fashion Store**. It showcases products, upcoming sale offers in a table, a "Why choose us" benefits section, and a footer with copyright.
The design uses modern CSS with gradients and subtle motion. A minimal JavaScript provides product quick view and a demo cart flow (no real payments).

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles for layout and appearance
- `script.js` — product + offer data and interactive behavior
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run locally
1. Unzip the files (if zipped). Open `index.html` in your browser — no server required for the demo features.
2. For local web server (optional): `python -m http.server 8000` then open http://localhost:8000

## To upload to GitHub
1. Create a repo on GitHub (e.g. `fashion-store`).
2. In your project folder locally:
```bash
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit — Fashion Store demo"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/fashion-store.git
git push -u origin main
```
If you prefer using GitHub Desktop, you can drag the folder there and publish the repository via the GUI.

## Notes / Next steps (suggestions)
- Add real product images and categories
- Integrate a backend or headless CMS for product management
- Add payment provider integration (Stripe, PayPal)
- Add user accounts and order tracking
